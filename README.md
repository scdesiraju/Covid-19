# COVID-19 Prediction Tool using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a COVID-19 Prediction tool leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease in patients based on the symptoms exhibited.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Utilized datasets containing symptom information and COVID-19 cases.
Preprocessing: Prepared the data by selecting relevant features and handling missing values.
Model Building: Employed various machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Neural Networks (MLPClassifier) for predictive modeling.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualization: Created visualizations to analyze the trends in COVID-19 cases and the effectiveness of the prediction models.
Deployment: Piloted the prediction tool in select hospitals to evaluate its real-world applicability.
Results:
The developed COVID-19 Prediction tool achieved an accuracy of 86.2% in predicting the likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease based on symptoms. The tool exhibited promising outcomes during pilot testing in hospitals, showcasing its potential utility in assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making.

Future Work:
Future enhancements may include:

Fine-tuning existing models for improved accuracy.
Incorporating additional features or data sources to enhance predictive capabilities.
